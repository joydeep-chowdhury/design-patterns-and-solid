Interpreter
The Interpreter pattern is used anytime we need to evaluate any kind of language grammar or expressions. A good example of this pattern would be Google Translate, which interprets the input, and shows us the output in another language.

Another example would be the Java compiler. The compiler interprets Java code and translates it into bytecode that the JVM uses to perform operations on the device it runs on.

This pattern also represents a great way to write simple programs that understand human-like syntax.
