Observer
The Observer pattern is used to monitor the state of a certain object, often in a group or one-to-many relationship. In such cases, most of the time, the changed state of a single object can affect the state of the rest, so there must be a system to note the change and alert the other objects.

While Java does provide both a class and an interface with this pattern in mind, it's not widespread because it wasn't realized in an ideal way.
