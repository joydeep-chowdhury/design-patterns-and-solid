Template Method
The Template Method, otherwise known as Template Pattern is all around us. It boils down to defining an abstract class that provides predefined ways to run its methods. Sub-classes that inherit these methods must also follow the way defined in the abstract class.

In some cases, the abstract class may already include a method implementation, not just instructions, if it's a functionality that will be shared amongst all or most of the sub-classes.
