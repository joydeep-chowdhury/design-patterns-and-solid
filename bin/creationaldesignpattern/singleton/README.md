Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures the existence of only one object instance in the whole JVM.

This is a rather simple pattern and it provides the ability to access this object even without instantiating it. Other design patterns use this pattern, like the Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns we've already covered.
