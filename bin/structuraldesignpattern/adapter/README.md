Adapter
The Adapter pattern, as the name implies, adapts one interface to another. It acts as a bridge between two unrelated, and sometimes even completely incompatible interfaces, similar to how a scanner acts as a bridge between a paper and a computer.

A computer can't store a paper as a PDF document, but a scanner, which combines the functionalities of both, can scan it and allow the computer to store it.
