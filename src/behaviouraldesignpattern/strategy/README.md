Strategy
The Strategy pattern is employed in situations where algorithms or class' behavior should be dynamic. This means that both the behavior and the algorithms can be changed at runtime, based on the input of the client.

Similar to the State Pattern, this pattern employs multiple strategy objects which define different strategies for the targeted class. The targeted class adapts its algorithms and behaviors based on these strategies.
