Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory design pattern builds upon the Factory Pattern and acts as the highest factory in the hierarchy. It represents the practice of creating a factory of factories.

This pattern is responsible for creating all other factories as its sub-classes, exactly like how factories are responsible for creating all of their own sub-classes.
