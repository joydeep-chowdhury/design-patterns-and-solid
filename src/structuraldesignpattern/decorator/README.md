Decorator
The Decorator pattern is used to alter an individual instance of a class at runtime, by creating a decorator class which wraps the original class.

This way, changing or adding functionalities of the decorator object won't affect the structure or the functionalities of the original object.

It differs from classic inheritance in the fact that it's done at runtime, and applies only to an individual instance, whereas inheritance will affect all instances, and is done at compile time.
